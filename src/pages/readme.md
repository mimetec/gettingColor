# gettingColor Pages

some components that are shared and some unique

maybe each page has it's own folder and each of those folders will have their own tests folder

orrr better yet, just one js file for each page and shove the most of it under features folder instead so they can be shared between pages even and each page.js is just importing things for rendering and not building things
